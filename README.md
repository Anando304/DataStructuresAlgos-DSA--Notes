# GameOfDots
-Two versions available: DFS and Non-DFS version
- The DFS version takes two inputs(start and end points) and returns a valid route(if it exists) to get there.
- The Non-DFS version is more specific to user input which allows the user to create the path
- So the main difference is that the DFS implementation creates the path for you while Non-DFS lets the user create the path.

# Program execution
