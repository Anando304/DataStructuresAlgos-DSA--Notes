I hereby attest that the code submitted is my individual work.

Assumptions And Design decisions:
The MainActivity class basically acts like the controller to execute BFS & DFS to find the path from Boston To Minneapolis.
This class also executes Dijkstras_shortpath.java located in "CAS2xb3_A2_zaman_AZ\src\CAS2xb3_A2_zaman_AZ\ShortestPathAlgos" folder.
The MainActivity class gets the start and end city from the input.txt file located in this same data folder.
The start city here is the first line which is BOSTON.
The end city is the second line which is MINNEAPOLIS.

When running any of the graph traversal,shortest path, or searching algorithms, the graph_create class has to be CALLED FIRST to initialize the graph.
The graph_create.java file is located in ".\CAS2xb3_A2_zaman_AZ\src\CAS2xb3_A2_zaman_AZ\GraphCreation"

The initial_cities_list() method needs to first be executed from the graph_create class. This is so that the list of all available cities are found
Next, an object of the graph_create class has to be made which represents the graph of the entire system of cities.
Following this, it is crucial that the create_edges() method of the graph_create object is executed so that the adjacency lists for each city can be added to the
corresponding cities in the graph.
These are the steps that are NECESSARY TO CREATE the GRAPH before running any other java files.

The MainActivity.java file takes care of running all these other files
