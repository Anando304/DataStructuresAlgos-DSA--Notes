\textbf{Ex 2.4.11:} Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations, but
only a few remove the maximum operations. Which priority-queue implementation do
you think would be most effective: heap, unordered array, or ordered array?\\
	
\textbf{Solution:}\\
Unordered array would be a better priority-queue with less cost for insert as we can insert it without carrying about order. If $Del\_max$ used a few times, then unorder is ideal since its great for fast insertions because it no longer matters where it is inserted. Ordered array would be ideal if $Del\_max()$ is done often as it makes removing the max element easy since array already in sorted order.\\

Ordered arrays have $O(N)$ insert with $O(1)$ $Del\_max$.\\
Unordered arrays have $O(1)$ insert with $O(N) \thickspace Del\_max$.\\
Binary Heaps have $O(logN)$ insert with $O(LogN) \thickspace Del\_max$ operations due to $Log N$ height of tree.\\
