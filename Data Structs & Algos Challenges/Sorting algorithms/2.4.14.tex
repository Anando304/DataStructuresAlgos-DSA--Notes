\textbf{Ex 2.4.14:} What is the minimum number of items that must be exchanged during a remove
the maximum operation in a heap of size N with no duplicate keys? Give a heap
of size 15 for which the minimum is achieved. Answer the same questions for two and
three successive remove the maximum operations.\\
	
\textbf{Solution:}\\
We can put numbers in a way that we get 2 as number of m in swaps. Worst case is $logN$ where we would have to check at each level if parent and any of its children have to be swapped. Best case is 2 swaps.
