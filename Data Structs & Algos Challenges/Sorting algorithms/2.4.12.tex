\textbf{Ex 2.4.12:} Suppose that your application will have a huge number of find the maximum
operations, but a relatively small number of insert and remove the maximum operations.
Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective: heap,
unordered array, or ordered array?\\
	
\textbf{Solution:}\\
Heap is good for avg case for large number of $find\_max$ with relatively small number of $insert()$ and $Del\_max()$ operations.If you have a large number of $del\_max$ ops, then best to use ordered array due to $O(1)$ complexity. If few deletions but more insertions, then an unordered array would be best.
