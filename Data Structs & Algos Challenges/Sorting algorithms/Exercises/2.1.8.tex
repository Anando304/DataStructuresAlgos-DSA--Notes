\textbf{Exercise 2.1.8:} Suppose that we use insertion sort on a randomly ordered array where elements
have only one of three values. Is the running time linear, quadratic, or something in
between?\\

\textbf{Solution:}
Insertion sort running time is linear ONLY when array is already sorted. This is because it does only $N-1$ comparisons with no swaps since the array is already sorted. For any other case, it runs on worst case of $O(N^2)$ complexity.
