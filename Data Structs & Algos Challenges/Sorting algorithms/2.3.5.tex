\textbf{Ex 2.3.5:} Give a code fragment that sorts an array that is known to consist of items having
just two distinct keys. ie; array consisting of 0's and 1's only.\\

\textbf{Solution:}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Partition the array so that smaller than 1 on the left while on the right is 1's. So essentially use one of the 1's as the pivot.
	\item Method 2: Count number of 0's and 1's and insert into an array OR pop ech 0 and 1 into seperate arrays, then merge them together. This isn't using the quicksort idea however whereas previous method does.
\end{itemize}
